### 1. Objective

The objective of this policy is to establish comprehensive standards for password creation, management, and protection that meet SOC 2 requirements while maintaining practical implementation. Strong password management is essential for preventing unauthorized access to company systems and protecting sensitive data.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all **[Company Name]** workforce members and any third party that requires access to company systems, applications, or data. It governs all passwords used to access company resources, whether managed internally or by external service providers.

### 3. Policy

All systems and applications must be configured to enforce the following password requirements. Exceptions must be documented and approved by the **[Role Title, e.g., IT Manager/Security Officer]**.

**3.1 Password Requirements**

All user passwords must meet these comprehensive standards:

- **Length:** Minimum twelve (12) characters for standard user accounts. Minimum sixteen (16) characters for accounts with administrative privileges.
    
- **Complexity:** Passwords must contain characters from at least three (3) of the following categories:
    - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
    - Lowercase letters (a-z)
    - Numbers (0-9)
    - Special characters (e.g., `!@#$%^&*()`)
        
- **Prohibited Content:** Passwords must not contain:
    - Company names or variations
    - Usernames or personal information
    - Dictionary words or common patterns (e.g., "password", "qwerty")
    - Consecutive or repeating characters

**3.2 Password Management**

- **Password Age:** User passwords must be changed at least every **[Number, e.g., 90]** days.
    
- **Password History:** Systems must prevent reuse of the previous **[Number, e.g., 5]** passwords.
    
- **Account Lockout:** User accounts must be automatically locked for **[Duration, e.g., 30 minutes]** after **[Number, e.g., 5]** consecutive failed login attempts.

**3.3 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

MFA is required for all workforce members and must be implemented on:

- All systems containing sensitive or confidential data
- Remote access to company networks (e.g., VPN)
- Administrative accounts and privileged access
- Cloud-based business applications and services

Approved MFA methods include authenticator applications, hardware tokens, or biometric identifiers. SMS-based MFA is discouraged for sensitive systems.

**3.4 Password Protection**

- Passwords must never be shared, written down, or stored in plain text
- Use of a company-approved password manager is strongly encouraged
- Passwords must not be transmitted via email or instant messaging
- Systems must store passwords using strong, salted hashing algorithms

**3.5 Password Resets and Initial Passwords**

- New accounts must receive randomly generated, temporary passwords
- Users must change temporary passwords upon first login
- Password reset requests must be verified through a secure process
- Service account passwords must be unique and rotated at least annually
    

### 4. Standards and Controls

This policy maps to the following regulatory and compliance frameworks:

|**Section**|**Framework**|**Control**|

### 1. Objective

The objective of this policy is to establish security requirements for mobile devices used to access **[Company Name]**'s information systems and data, including both company-owned devices and personal devices used for business purposes (Bring Your Own Device - BYOD). This policy ensures that mobile device usage maintains the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of company information while supporting workforce mobility and productivity in compliance with SOC 2 requirements.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all **[Company Name]** workforce members, including employees, contractors, temporary staff, and third parties who use mobile devices to access company information systems, email, applications, or data. It covers all mobile computing devices including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and any other portable computing device capable of storing, processing, or transmitting company information. This policy applies regardless of device ownership (company-owned or personal).

### 3. Policy

All mobile devices accessing **[Company Name]** information systems and data shall be subject to appropriate security controls to protect against unauthorized access, data loss, and security breaches.

**3.1 Mobile Device Requirements**

Mobile devices shall be classified based on their access to company information and subject to corresponding security requirements.

**Standard Access Devices:** Devices with access to email and internal business systems
- Mobile device management (MDM) enrollment required
- Passcode/PIN protection mandatory (minimum **[Number, e.g., 6 digits]**)
- Multi-factor authentication required for business applications
- Device encryption mandatory
- Automatic screen lock after **[Duration, e.g., 5 minutes]** of inactivity

**Confidential Access Devices:** Devices with access to Confidential information
- Company-owned devices preferred
- Enhanced MDM enrollment with compliance monitoring
- Hardware-based encryption required
- Continuous compliance monitoring
- Application containerization for business data separation

**3.2 Acceptable Mobile Devices**

Only approved mobile device types and operating systems shall be permitted to access company information:

**Approved Device Types:**
- Smartphones running current iOS or Android versions with security patches within **[Timeframe, e.g., 90 days]**
- Tablets running current iPadOS or Android versions with security patches within **[Timeframe, e.g., 90 days]**
- Laptops running current Windows, macOS, or approved Linux distributions with latest security updates

**Prohibited Devices:**
- Devices with modified firmware (jailbroken/rooted devices) - automatically blocked by MDM
- Devices running unsupported or end-of-life operating systems
- Devices with known critical vulnerabilities that are unpatched

**3.3 Mobile Device Management (MDM)**

All mobile devices accessing company information shall be enrolled in the **[Company Name]** Mobile Device Management system.

- All devices shall be enrolled in MDM before accessing company information
- Device enrollment shall require management approval and IT verification
- Users shall accept MDM terms and conditions including remote wipe capabilities
- Device compliance shall be verified before initial access is granted

**MDM Security Policies:**
- Minimum passcode/password complexity requirements
- Automatic screen lock after defined inactivity period
- Maximum failed unlock attempts before device lock/wipe
- Automatic device encryption enforcement
- Approved application catalog with pre-approved business applications
- VPN requirements for accessing internal systems
- Prohibition of unsecured Wi-Fi networks for business use

**3.4 Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Program**

Personal devices may be used for business purposes under the BYOD program with appropriate security controls and user agreements.

- BYOD participation shall require a formal application and approval process
- Device compatibility assessment and security evaluation are required
- A signed BYOD agreement is mandatory, including consent to security policies and remote wipe capabilities
- Annual device revalidation and security assessment

**BYOD Security Requirements:**
- Current operating system with latest security patches
- Strong device passcode/biometric authentication
- Automatic screen lock configuration
- Full device encryption enabled
- Remote wipe capability acceptance
- Separation of business and personal data through containerization
- Business applications and data contained within managed workspace
- Selective wipe capability for business data only

**3.5 Security Controls and Monitoring**

Security controls shall be implemented to protect mobile devices and monitor for security threats.

- Multi-factor authentication required for all business applications
- Full device encryption mandatory for all devices accessing company information
- Data-in-transit encryption using approved protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher)
- Continuous device compliance monitoring through MDM
- Anomalous behavior detection and alerting
- Integration with security monitoring systems

**3.6 Incident Response and Device Management**

Procedures shall be established for responding to mobile device security incidents and managing device lifecycle events.

**Lost or Stolen Device Procedures:**
- All lost or stolen devices must be reported to the **[Role Title, e.g., IT Manager/Security Officer]** immediately
- Remote location and tracking attempts where technically feasible
- Remote lock and wipe procedures
- Access credential revocation and reset
- Incident documentation and lessons learned

**Device Lifecycle Management:**
- Security assessment and approval process for new devices
- MDM enrollment and configuration
- User training on security requirements
- Regular compliance monitoring and reporting
- Complete data wipe and sanitization upon device retirement
- MDM unenrollment and access revocation

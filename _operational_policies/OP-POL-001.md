### 1. Objective

The objective of this policy is to establish requirements for the implementation, management, and governance of cryptographic controls and encryption key management at **[Company Name]**. This policy ensures that sensitive information is protected through appropriate encryption technologies and that cryptographic keys are securely generated, distributed, stored, and disposed of in compliance with SOC 2 requirements.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all **[Company Name]** workforce members, contractors, and third parties who handle, process, store, or transmit encrypted information or manage cryptographic keys. It encompasses all information systems, applications, databases, storage devices, communication channels, and backup media containing sensitive data. This policy covers all encryption technologies across computing environments including on-premises, cloud, and mobile platforms.

### 3. Policy

**[Company Name]** shall implement and maintain cryptographic controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of sensitive information throughout its lifecycle.

**3.1 Encryption Requirements**

Encryption shall be implemented for all sensitive information based on data classification levels and regulatory requirements.

**Confidential Data Requirements:**
- Data at rest: Encrypted using AES-256 or equivalent approved algorithm
- Data in transit: Encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher with strong cipher suite configuration
- Mobile devices and removable media: Full device/media encryption mandatory
- Database encryption for sensitive data fields using transparent data encryption (TDE) or column-level encryption
- Email encryption for messages containing sensitive data
- Backup encryption for all backup media and archives

**Authentication Credentials:**
- Password hashes using strong, salted cryptographic hash function (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2)
- API keys and tokens encrypted at rest
- Digital certificates and private keys protected by secure key storage mechanisms

**3.2 Encryption Standards and Algorithms**

Only cryptographically strong, industry-standard algorithms and protocols approved by the **[Role Title, e.g., IT Manager/Security Officer]** shall be used.

**Approved Symmetric Encryption Algorithms:**
- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 for authenticated encryption

**Approved Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms:**
- RSA with minimum key length of 3072 bits
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) with minimum key length of 256 bits

**Approved Hash Functions:**
- SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512 for data integrity
- bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 for password hashing

**Prohibited Algorithms:**
- DES, 3DES, MD5, SHA-1, RC4, RSA keys shorter than 3072 bits, SSL v2/v3, TLS 1.0/1.1

**3.3 Key Management Framework**

A key management system shall be implemented to ensure the secure lifecycle management of all cryptographic keys.

**Key Management Principles:**
- Separation of duties for key management roles and responsibilities
- Least privilege access to cryptographic keys
- Secure key generation using approved cryptographically secure random number generators
- Keys stored separately from the data they protect
- Multi-factor authentication required for access to key management systems

**Key Rotation and Lifecycle:**
- Data encryption keys: Annually or after encrypting **[Amount, e.g., 1TB]** of data
- SSL/TLS certificates: Annually or as required by Certificate Authority
- Authentication keys (e.g., API keys): Every **[Duration, e.g., 6 months]**
- Emergency key rotation upon suspected compromise or security incidents

**Key Destruction:**
- Cryptographic keys shall be securely destroyed when no longer required
- Secure deletion methods (cryptographic erasure, overwriting with random data)
- All key destruction activities logged and auditable

**3.4 Digital Certificates and PKI**

**[Company Name]** shall maintain appropriate PKI capabilities to support digital certificates and public key cryptography.

- Certificate requests shall be validated and approved through a documented process
- Certificate revocation capabilities shall be maintained through Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
- Automated monitoring shall ensure expired or revoked certificates are removed from systems

**3.5 Cloud Encryption**

All use of cloud services must adhere to cryptographic requirements defined in the Infrastructure Security Policy (ENG-POL-003).

- Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) shall be used for production data stores containing Confidential data
- Cloud provider encryption services and configurations shall be reviewed and approved before use
- Company-controlled key management services shall be the standard for all cloud-based encryption

**3.6 Monitoring and Performance**

Encryption implementations shall be monitored for performance impact and security effectiveness.

- Encryption overhead shall be measured and optimized
- Cryptographic failures and misconfigurations shall be logged and trigger automated alerts
- Key management system access and activity logs shall be monitored for suspicious activity
- Annual review of cryptographic standards shall be conducted to maintain current security practices

### 4. Standards Compliance

This policy is designed to comply with and support the following industry standards and regulations.

|**Policy Section**|**Standard/Framework**|**Control Reference**|
|---|---|---|
|**3.1, 3.3**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC6.1 - Logical Access Security|
|**3.4, 3.5**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC6.6 - Other Controls to Achieve Logical Access Security|
|**3.3**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC6.8 - Restricts Access to Encrypted Data|

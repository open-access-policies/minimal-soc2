### 1. Purpose

To outline the process for formally requesting, approving, and documenting an exception to a remediation Service Level Agreement (SLA) for an identified vulnerability.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies when an asset owner cannot remediate a vulnerability within the timeframe defined in the Vulnerability Management Policy and requires a formal exception.

### 3. Overview

This procedure provides a streamlined pathway for managing situations where immediate vulnerability remediation is not feasible. It details the steps for an asset owner to request an exception, the simplified approval workflow, and the requirement to document approved exceptions in the risk register for regular review.

## About This Framework

Building a comprehensive SOC 2 compliance program requires robust policies and procedures that satisfy auditor requirements while remaining practical for implementation. This framework provides a complete Information Security Management System (ISMS) designed specifically for SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria compliance.

The documentation establishes security governance, risk management, access controls, system operations, and incident response capabilities that auditors expect to see in mature organizations. Each document includes clear SOC 2 control mappings and professional language suitable for regulatory review.

## Implementation Approach

This framework implements a comprehensive approach to SOC 2 compliance:

- **Policies** establish security requirements and management commitment
- **Procedures** provide detailed implementation guidance and operational steps  
- **ISMS Supplements** offer implementation roadmaps and organizational tools
- **Control Mapping** ensures complete coverage of SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria

Start by reviewing the Information Security Policy (SEC-POL-001) to understand the overall ISMS structure, then examine policies and procedures relevant to your organization's specific needs.

## SOC 2 Trust Services Coverage

This framework provides complete coverage of:
- **Common Criteria (CC1-CC8)**: Control Environment, Communication, Risk Management, Monitoring, Control Activities, Logical Access, System Operations, Change Management

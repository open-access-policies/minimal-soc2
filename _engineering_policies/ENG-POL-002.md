- **Development:** Code and configuration changes shall be developed in non-production environments.
    
- **Review:** All changes shall be reviewed and approved by at least one qualified team member before production deployment.
    
- **Testing:** Changes shall be tested to verify functionality and identify potential issues before production deployment.
    
- **Approval:** Production deployment shall require documented approval from authorized personnel.
    
- **Documentation:** All changes shall be documented with details of what was changed, who approved it, and when it was deployed.

**3.2 Emergency Changes**

- **Review:** Peer review is still required but may be expedited to address the emergency.
    
- **Documentation:** Emergency changes shall be fully documented within **[Number, e.g., 24]** hours of deployment.
    
- **Follow-up:** A review of emergency changes shall be conducted within **[Number, e.g., 3]** business days to identify process improvements.

**3.3 Change Documentation**

All changes shall be properly documented and tracked:

- **Change Records:** Each change shall have a record that includes description, justification, approver, and deployment date.
    
- **Version Control:** Code changes shall be managed through version control systems with appropriate branching and review processes.
    
- **Audit Trail:** Change documentation shall be maintained for audit purposes and compliance review.

**3.4 Production Access Controls**

Access to production systems shall be controlled and monitored:

- **Restricted Access:** Production system access shall be limited to authorized personnel only.
    
- **Privileged Access:** Administrative access to production systems shall require additional approval and monitoring.
    
- **Access Logging:** All production system access and changes shall be logged for security monitoring.

**3.5 Change Communication**

Relevant stakeholders shall be notified of changes that may impact operations:

- **Internal Notification:** Team members shall be notified of upcoming production changes through established communication channels.

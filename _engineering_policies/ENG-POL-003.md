### 1. Objective

The objective of this policy is to establish security requirements for the configuration and management of **[Company Name]**'s cloud infrastructure in accordance with industry-standard security benchmarks. This policy ensures that all infrastructure components are configured and hardened according to specific cloud provider security benchmarks while maintaining SOC 2 compliance and practical implementation for cloud-first operations.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all **[Company Name]** workforce members, contractors, and third parties involved in the configuration, deployment, or management of cloud infrastructure. It encompasses all cloud infrastructure components including compute instances, databases, storage services, networking components, identity services, and security tools across all approved cloud platforms. This policy covers production, staging, and development environments.

### 3. Policy

**[Company Name]** shall configure and maintain cloud infrastructure in accordance with industry-standard security benchmarks for the specific cloud provider(s) being used.

**3.1 Cloud Provider Security Benchmarks**

All cloud infrastructure shall be configured and hardened in accordance with industry-standard benchmarks for the specific cloud provider being used.

**Required Security Benchmarks:**
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** CIS Benchmarks for AWS
- **Microsoft Azure:** Azure Security Benchmark
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** CIS Benchmarks for Google Cloud Platform
- **Multi-cloud environments:** Apply provider-specific benchmarks to each cloud platform component

**Benchmark Implementation:**
- New infrastructure deployments shall be configured according to applicable security benchmarks
- Existing infrastructure shall be assessed against current benchmarks and remediated as needed
- Benchmark compliance shall be validated through automated scanning tools where available
- Deviations from benchmarks shall be documented with business justification and compensating controls

**3.2 Cloud-Native Security Controls**

Cloud infrastructure shall utilize cloud provider native security services and capabilities to implement defense-in-depth security.

**Identity and Access Management:**
- Implement cloud provider IAM services with role-based access control and least privilege principles
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative access
- Use cloud provider access logging and monitoring services
- Implement service accounts and roles according to cloud provider best practices

**Network Security:**
- Configure security groups, network ACLs, and firewall rules according to benchmark recommendations
- Implement network segmentation using cloud provider networking services
- Enable VPC flow logs or equivalent network monitoring capabilities
- Use cloud provider managed VPN or private connectivity services for secure access

**Data Protection:**
- Enable encryption at rest using cloud provider managed encryption services
- Configure encryption in transit using cloud provider recommended protocols and services
- Implement backup encryption using cloud provider backup and archive services
- Use cloud provider key management services for cryptographic key management

**3.3 Infrastructure as Code and Configuration Management**

Infrastructure deployments shall be managed through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices with security validation.

**IaC Security Requirements:**
- All infrastructure shall be defined and deployed using IaC templates (e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform, ARM templates)
- IaC templates shall be scanned for security misconfigurations before deployment
- Template configurations shall align with applicable cloud provider security benchmarks
- Version control shall be used for all infrastructure code with appropriate access controls

**Configuration Drift Prevention:**
- Automated monitoring shall detect configuration drift from approved security baselines
- Configuration changes outside of IaC processes shall trigger alerts and require remediation
- Regular compliance scanning shall validate continued adherence to security benchmarks

**3.4 Monitoring and Compliance Validation**

Cloud infrastructure shall be continuously monitored for security compliance and threats.

**Cloud Security Monitoring:**
- Enable cloud provider security monitoring services (e.g., AWS Security Hub, Azure Security Center, GCP Security Command Center)
- Configure automated alerts for security misconfigurations and benchmark deviations
- Implement centralized logging using cloud provider logging services
- Enable cloud provider threat detection services where available

**Compliance Assessment:**
- Quarterly assessment of infrastructure against applicable cloud provider security benchmarks
- Automated compliance scanning using cloud provider native tools or approved third-party solutions
- Remediation tracking for identified security misconfigurations and benchmark deviations
- Annual review of benchmark implementations to incorporate updated recommendations

**3.5 Incident Response and Recovery**

Cloud infrastructure shall support incident response activities and business continuity requirements.

**Cloud Incident Response:**
- Implement cloud provider incident response capabilities and integrations
- Enable cloud provider backup and disaster recovery services
- Configure automated backup policies according to business requirements
- Test backup and recovery procedures at least annually for critical systems

### 4. Standards Compliance

This policy is designed to comply with and support the following industry standards and regulations.

|**Policy Section**|**Standard/Framework**|**Control Reference**|
|---|---|---|
|**3.1, 3.3**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC6.1 - Logical Access Security|
|**3.2**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC6.6 - Network Security|
|**3.4**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC6.7 - Data Transmission|
|**3.6**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC7.1 - System Monitoring|
|**3.7**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC7.1 - System Monitoring|
|**3.5**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC8.1 - Change Management|

### 5. Definitions

**Cloud Security Benchmark:** Industry-standard security configuration guidelines specific to cloud platforms (e.g., CIS Benchmarks, Azure Security Benchmark).

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Practice of managing and provisioning cloud infrastructure through machine-readable template files.

**Configuration Drift:** Unintended changes to infrastructure configurations that deviate from approved security baselines.

**Cloud Provider Native Security Services:** Security capabilities and services built into cloud platforms by the cloud provider.

### 6. Responsibilities

|**Role**|**Responsibility**|
|---|---|
|**IT Manager/Security Officer**|Establish cloud security policies, ensure benchmark compliance, oversee security monitoring, and coordinate cloud incident response.|
|**Cloud Operations Team**|Configure cloud infrastructure according to security benchmarks, implement IaC practices, monitor for configuration drift, and maintain cloud security controls.|

### 1. Objective

The objective of this policy is to establish security requirements for the design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of **[Company Name]**'s IT infrastructure. This policy ensures that all infrastructure components including cloud services, networks, servers, databases, and supporting systems are configured and managed with appropriate security controls to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information systems while maintaining SOC 2 compliance.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all **[Company Name]** workforce members, contractors, and third parties involved in the design, deployment, configuration, or management of IT infrastructure. It encompasses all infrastructure components including cloud platforms, virtual machines, databases, networks, storage systems, backup infrastructure, monitoring systems, and security tools. This policy covers production, staging, and development environments.

### 3. Policy

**[Company Name]** shall implement layered security controls across all infrastructure components to ensure protection against threats and maintain SOC 2 compliance.

**3.1 Infrastructure Security Framework**

A security framework shall be implemented across all infrastructure components to ensure consistent security posture.

- Network security controls including firewalls, security groups, and access control lists
- Identity and access management (IAM) with role-based access control and least privilege
- Data protection through encryption at rest and in transit
- Logging and monitoring integration across infrastructure components
- Incident response capabilities with recovery procedures

**3.2 System Security and Hardening**

Infrastructure systems shall be configured according to security baselines and maintained with current security updates.

- Security baselines for operating systems and platforms shall be documented and implemented
- Removal of unnecessary services, protocols, and software components
- Vulnerability scanning shall be conducted at least quarterly for production systems
- Patch management shall be performed according to defined timeframes
- Network segmentation for different security zones

**3.3 Access Control and Authentication**

Infrastructure access shall be controlled through formal processes implementing least privilege principles.

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for all administrative access
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with predefined roles and permissions
- Quarterly access reviews for administrative and privileged accounts
- Immediate access revocation upon role changes or employment termination
- Audit logging for all infrastructure access and changes

**3.4 Data Protection and Encryption**

Data protection controls shall ensure the confidentiality and integrity of information within the infrastructure.

- Encryption at rest for all sensitive data storage including databases and file systems
- Encryption in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher for all network communications
- Secure key management using cloud-native key management services
- Regular key rotation according to defined schedules
- Backup data encryption for all backup media and archives

**3.5 Infrastructure Management and Change Control**

Infrastructure deployments and changes shall be managed through documented processes to maintain security and stability.

- All infrastructure changes shall be documented, tested, and approved before implementation
- Version control shall be used for infrastructure code and configuration management
- Security scanning of infrastructure templates and configurations
- Automated deployment pipelines with security validation
- Change tracking and rollback capabilities for configuration modifications

**3.6 Backup and Recovery**

Backup and recovery capabilities shall ensure business continuity and data protection.

- Regular automated backups for all critical systems and data
- Encryption of all backup data at rest and in transit
- Geographic distribution of backups for disaster recovery
- Backup integrity validation shall be performed at least quarterly for critical systems
- Documented backup and recovery procedures with defined recovery time objectives

**3.7 Monitoring and Incident Response**

Infrastructure monitoring shall provide threat detection and support incident response activities.

- Continuous monitoring of infrastructure components and services
- Centralized log collection and analysis with appropriate retention periods
- Automated threat detection and alerting capabilities
- Integration with organizational incident response procedures
- Evidence preservation capabilities for infrastructure incidents

### 4. Standards Compliance

This policy is designed to comply with and support the following industry standards and regulations.

|**Policy Section**|**Standard/Framework**|**Control Reference**|
|---|---|---|
|**3.1, 3.3**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC6.1 - Logical Access Security|
|**3.2**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC6.6 - Network Security|
|**3.4**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC6.7 - Data Transmission|
|**3.6**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC7.1 - System Monitoring|
|**3.7**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC7.1 - System Monitoring|
|**3.5**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC8.1 - Change Management|

### 5. Definitions

**Encryption at Rest:** Protection of data stored on disk or other storage media through cryptographic methods.

**Encryption in Transit:** Protection of data while being transmitted between systems through cryptographic methods.

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files.

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Authentication method requiring two or more verification factors to gain access.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Method of restricting system access based on the roles of individual users within an organization.

### 1. Objective

The objective of this policy is to establish comprehensive security requirements for software development at **[Company Name]** that meet SOC 2 requirements while maintaining practical implementation. This policy ensures security controls are integrated into development processes to protect company information systems and maintain system security.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all **[Company Name]** workforce members involved in software development, including developers, testers, and DevOps personnel. It covers all software development projects including new applications, system modifications, and third-party integrations across all environments (development, testing, production).

### 3. Policy

**[Company Name]** implements security principles throughout the software development lifecycle to ensure applications and systems are built with appropriate security controls.

**3.1 Security by Design**

Security shall be considered and integrated throughout all phases of software development rather than added as an afterthought.

- **Security Requirements:** Security considerations shall be identified and documented for applications that handle sensitive data based on the Data Classification and Handling Policy (SEC-POL-004).

- **Threat Modeling:** Development teams shall consider potential security threats and design appropriate mitigations for applications handling Confidential data.

- **Secure Architecture:** Applications shall be designed with security principles including defense in depth, least privilege, and fail-safe defaults.

**3.2 Automated Security Integration**

All code shall undergo automated security scanning before deployment to production using tools integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

- **Continuous Security Testing:** Automated security scanning tools shall be integrated into the development pipeline to identify vulnerabilities early in the development process.

- **Build Failure on Critical Issues:** The build process shall fail if critical security vulnerabilities are detected, preventing insecure code from reaching production.

- **Tool Maintenance:** Security scanning tools shall be kept current with the latest vulnerability signatures and detection capabilities.

**3.3 Code Quality and Review**

All production code changes shall undergo review processes to ensure quality and security standards are met.

- **Peer Review:** All code changes shall be reviewed by at least one qualified team member before deployment to production.

- **Security Focus:** Code reviews shall include consideration of security implications, secure coding practices, and potential vulnerabilities.

- **Documentation:** Review approvals and any identified issues shall be documented in the version control system.

**3.4 Shared Security Responsibility**

Security is a shared team responsibility, with all team members contributing to secure development practices.

- **Team Accountability:** All development team members are responsible for following secure coding practices and identifying potential security issues.

- **Team Lead Oversight:** Team leads are responsible for ensuring team members understand and follow secure development practices and receive appropriate security training.

- **Collaborative Security:** Security considerations shall be discussed openly within development teams and integrated into regular development activities.

**3.5 Third-Party Component Security**

Third-party libraries and components shall be managed to minimize security risks.

- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Third-party components shall be regularly scanned for known security vulnerabilities using automated tools.

- **Update Management:** Third-party components with known security vulnerabilities shall be updated promptly or replaced with secure alternatives.

- **Component Inventory:** An inventory of third-party components shall be maintained to support security tracking and vulnerability management.

**3.6 Security Training and Awareness**

Development team members shall receive appropriate security training to support secure development practices.

- **Initial Training:** New development team members shall receive secure coding training within **[Number, e.g., 90]** days of starting.

- **Ongoing Education:** Development team members shall receive regular security training updates covering current threats and secure development practices.

- **Practical Application:** Security training shall focus on practical application of secure coding principles relevant to the company's development technologies and practices.

### 4. Standards Compliance

This policy is designed to comply with and support the following industry standards and regulations.

|**Policy Section**|**Standard/Framework**|**Control Reference**|
|---|---|---|
|**All**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC8.1 - System Development|
|**3.3, 3.4**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC7.1 - System Monitoring|
|**3.2**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC6.1 - Logical Access Security|

### 5. Definitions

**Automated Security Scanning:** Tools that automatically analyze code, dependencies, and applications for security vulnerabilities.

**Code Review:** The systematic examination of source code by peers to identify defects and security vulnerabilities before deployment.

**Secure Coding:** Programming practices that prevent common security vulnerabilities and implement appropriate security controls.

**Third-Party Component:** External software libraries, frameworks, or modules used in application development.

### 6. Responsibilities

|**Role**|**Responsibility**|
|---|---|
|**IT Manager/Security Officer**|Develop and maintain secure development policies and ensure security scanning tools are available and current.|
|**Development Team Lead**|Ensure team compliance with secure development practices, coordinate code reviews, and ensure team members receive appropriate security training.|
|**Software Developers**|Follow secure coding practices, participate in code reviews, complete required security training, and report security vulnerabilities.|
|**All Development Team Members**|Support security initiatives and collaborate on implementing secure development practices within their teams.|

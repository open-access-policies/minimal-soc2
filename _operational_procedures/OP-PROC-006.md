### 4. Procedure

| **Step** | **Who**                      | **What**                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | Human Resources (HR)         | Extends a contingent offer of employment to the selected candidate. The offer explicitly states that employment is conditional upon the successful completion of a background check. |
| **2**    | Candidate                    | Receives the contingent offer and provides written consent for the company to conduct a background check via the approved third-party screening provider.               |
| **3**    | Third-Party Provider         | Conducts the background check, which may include criminal history, employment verification, and education verification, in accordance with applicable laws.             |
| **4**    | Human Resources (HR) & Security Officer | Receive and review the background check report from the provider.                                                                                             |
| **5**    | Human Resources (HR) & Security Officer | If the report contains adverse findings, they jointly review the findings to determine if they pose an unacceptable risk and would disqualify the candidate from employment. |
| **6**    | Human Resources (HR)         | If the check is passed, confirms the final offer of employment. If the check is not passed, follows legal mandates for adverse action.                              |
| **7**    | Human Resources (HR)         | Documents the completed background check in the candidate's confidential personnel file.                                                                              |

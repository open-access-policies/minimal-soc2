### 1. Purpose

To provide a formal checklist and process to ensure all security-related tasks are consistently and verifiably completed during employee onboarding and termination.

This procedure applies to all new and departing employees, contractors, and temporary staff. It involves the Human Resources (HR) department, the IT department, and the hiring manager.

### 3. Overview

This procedure establishes standardized checklists for the security-related aspects of employee onboarding and offboarding.
